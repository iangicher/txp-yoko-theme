Get and install the plugin "cxc_templates":https://github.com/yauh/txp-cxc-templates/blob/master/cxc_templates_v0.4.5.txt in the Textpattern admin area

Activate the cxc_templates plugin in your admin area (click on the _no_ to set it to _yes_)

Create two directories in your web root to allow cxc_templates to work properly (/tmp should have chmod 777):

<public_root>/tpl
<public_root>/textpattern/tmp

upload the extracted yoko folder to the tpl folder you created

Import the theme using the extension tab (go to Extensions-->Templates and select yoko from the drop-down list)

Import the yoko_textpack file for your site's language setting from the assets folder (e.g. yoko_textpack_en-us.txt) and import it in the Preferences-->Language tab on the admin side. If there is no textpack file available for your language you may create one yourself.

Navigate between the main menu entries "Presentation, Admin, and Content" to make sure there are no error messages. There may be some on the first click.
